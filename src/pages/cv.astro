      <p class="text-lg">
        Specializing in newborn to 6-year-old care with over 15 years of professional
        nanny experience. I provide nurturing, developmentally-focused care for infants
        and young children, with expertise spanning the crucial early years from birth
        through early elementary. I am bilingual in Spanish and English, supporting early
        language development and effective communication with diverse families. I hold
        current Infant and Child CPR and Emergency Care certifications, maintain a valid
        Virginia driver's license, and keep all standard vaccinations up to date.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="text-lg">
        My approach centers on building genuine, long-term relationships where I become
        a trusted part of the household. Families often call me "Nina"—a testament to
        the deep bonds I form with each child. I provide comprehensive care including
        daily routines, enrichment activities, meal preparation, light housekeeping
        related to childcare, and flexible support for weekends or date nights.
